# Hello, I'm Dhruv | @JNGCoding

Hey there, Welcome to my profile on Github. I'm a passionate programmer, I build various projects from A - Z in languages from A - Z. I'm a guy who adapts to difficult situations quickly learning things at blazing speeds. Please feel free to take a look at my projects.

## About Me

- **Languages I Work With**:  
  C / C++ • Java • Python • Go • Kotlin (for mobile development)

- **Fields of Interest**:  
  Software Development • Embedded Systems • Game Development • Automation • Real-Time Systems

- **Philosophy**:  
  I believe adaptability is the most powerful human trait.  
  Practical experience is the best teacher—skills are earned, not memorized.  
  Theory is important, but it’s the doing that makes you a developer.

## Projects I've Built (or Am Building)

Even though I haven’t uploaded most of my work yet, here’s a sneak peek:

- **Java Screen Recorder**  
  A lightweight desktop screen recorder built using Java and JCodec.

- **Real-Time Graphing Software (Python)**  
  Dynamically updates graphs based on live changes to mathematical equations.

- **Custom C++ Parser**  
  Executes commands at runtime using a custom-built parsing engine.

- **Expression Evaluator in C**  
  Parses and evaluates expressions like `1+2+3` with precision and speed.

- **Home Automation with ESP8266**  
  Smart relay control based on sensor data and user input—IoT meets intelligence.

- **My Own Programming Language (Java)**  
  Designed for beginners who struggle with high-level syntax.  
  Each line is a standalone instruction interpreted and executed accordingly.

- **OV7670 Camera Library (TinyGO)**  
  Built a custom library to interface with the OV7670 camera module using TinyGO.

- **Java Chat Application**  
  Peer-to-peer messaging with a clean UI and socket-based communication.

- **Health AI Backend (HackCBS 8.0)**  
  Designed and implemented the backend for a health assistant platform using REST APIs and modular logic.

- **Computer Diagnostics and Statistics Monitor**
  Take a look at your CPU, GPU, RAM Usage and their usage graph over time with this project at any time, working with both hardware and software.
