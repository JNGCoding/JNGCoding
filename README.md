# 👋 Hello, I'm Dhruv | @JNGCoding

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! I'm a passionate programmer who thrives on building meaningful, functional, and sometimes just plain cool things across multiple domains—from software and embedded systems to game development and automation.

## 🚀 About Me

- 💻 **Languages I Work With**:  
  C / C++ • Java • Python • Go • Kotlin (for mobile development)

- 🧠 **Fields of Interest**:  
  Software Development • Embedded Systems • Game Development • Automation • Real-Time Systems

- 🔧 **Philosophy**:  
  I believe adaptability is the most powerful human trait.  
  Practical experience is the best teacher—skills are earned, not memorized.  
  Theory is important, but it’s the doing that makes you a developer.

## 🧪 Projects I'm Proud Of

Even though I haven’t uploaded most of my work yet, here are some of the projects I’ve built or am currently working on:

- 🎥 **Java Screen Recorder**  
  A lightweight desktop screen recorder built using Java and JCodec.

- 📈 **Real-Time Graphing Software (Python)**  
  Dynamically updates graphs based on live changes to mathematical equations.

- 🧩 **Custom C++ Parser**  
  Executes commands at runtime using a custom-built parsing engine.

- ➕ **Expression Evaluator in C**  
  Parses and evaluates expressions like `1+2+3` with precision and speed.

- 🏠 **Home Automation with ESP8266**  
  Smart relay control based on sensor data and user input—IoT meets intelligence.

- 🧠 **My Own Programming Language**\n
  Designed and implemented a custom programming language in Java, is built for people who wants to learn programming basics but doesn't understand the syntax of High-level languages like python, Java, etc.
  My language follows a basic syntax - each line is a seperate instruction which the interpreter will perform actions to accordingly.
